## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js. This the [deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).

### This is optional, but just try these baozi

> **Bun is under active development.** Use it to speed up your development workflows or run simpler production code in resource-constrained environments like serverless functions. We're working on more complete Node.js compatibility and integration with existing frameworks. Join the [Discord](https://bun.sh/discord) and watch the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun) to keep tabs on future releases.

Bun is an all-in-one toolkit for JavaScript and TypeScript apps. It ships as a single executable called `bun`.

At its core is the _Bun runtime_, a fast JavaScript runtime designed as a drop-in replacement for Node.js. It's written in Zig and powered by JavaScriptCore under the hood, dramatically reducing startup times and memory usage.

```bash
bun run index.tsx             # TS and JSX supported out-of-the-box
```

The `bun` command-line tool also implements a test runner, script runner, and Node.js-compatible package manager. Instead of 1,000 node_modules for development, you only need `bun`. Bun's built-in tools are significantly faster than existing options and usable in existing Node.js projects with little to no changes.

```bash
bun test                      # run tests
bun run start                 # run the `start` script in `package.json`
bun install <pkg>             # install a package
bunx cowsay 'Hello, world!'   # execute a package
```

### Install

Bun supports Linux (x64 & arm64), macOS (x64 & Apple Silicon) and Windows (x64).

> **Linux users** — Kernel version 5.6 or higher is strongly recommended, but the minimum is 5.1.

```sh
# with install script (recommended)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# on windows
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"

# with npm
npm install -g bun

# with Homebrew
brew tap oven-sh/bun
brew install bun

# with Docker
docker pull oven/bun
docker run --rm --init --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 oven/bun
```

### Upgrade

To upgrade to the latest version of Bun, run:

```sh
bun upgrade
```

Bun automatically releases a canary build on every commit to `main`. To upgrade to the latest canary build, run:

```sh
bun upgrade --canary
```
